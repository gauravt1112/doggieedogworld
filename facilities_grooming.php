							<p class="title">Grooming Is An Essential Part Of Pet Care And Helps To Enhance The Pet's Hygiene And Appearance.</p>
							<p>The best time to start grooming your pet is after it has had all its vaccinations, which is approximately at the age of 3 months. The sooner you introduce your pet to professional grooming, the happier it will be, removing any fear it may tend to develop. All pets require daily grooming; the kind and style of grooming will depend on their breed, age and health.</p>
						</div>
						<p class="title">Benefits Of Daily Grooming:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Reduces the likelihood of various skin problems and infestation of parasites.</li>
							<li>Monitors the pet's health by checking for cuts, swelling, limps or changes in temperature, all of which are indicative of illness.</li>
						</ul>

							<p class="title">We At Doggiie Dog World Understand That While You Love Your Pet, You May Not Always Have The Time To Devote To Their Daily Grooming Needs.</p>
							<p>Dogs love to play on the beach, run in the woods and roll in muddy puddles.</p>
							<p>Though this is an essential part of their life, it also makes them dirty and grubby, and causes skin problems and parasitical infestation.</p>
							<p>We at Doggiie Dog World, understand that while you love your pet, you may not always have the time to devote to their daily grooming needs. That is why we take on the responsibility to provide professional grooming, which helps keep your pet happy and healthy and gives you more hassle-free leisure time with it.</p>
							<p>Besides dogs, we also groom cats. While its true that cats themselves are expert groomers, it helps to give them an occasional professional grooming session.</p>
							<p>At Doggiie Dog World, we offer a relaxing and loving grooming environment for dogs and cats of all ages and sizes. Our facilities are air-conditioned and we use the latest equipment including:</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wrapper">
						<ul>
							<li>Hydraulic grooming tables/bath tubs.</li>
							<li>High impact dryers.</li>
							<li>Best quality shampoo and conditioner, specifically designed for animals.</li>
							<li>Clean towels.</li>							
						</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="wrapper">
							<p>At Doggiie Dog World, we believe that prevention is better than cure.   Don't wait until your pet is matted - which leads to many skin conditions such as hot spots and sores, parasitical infestation, itching, infections, discolouration and staining of fur.</p>
							<p>Book your appointment NOW, to ensure your dog always feels good and well cared for. This could also save you possible unnecessary veterinarian bills.</p>
							<p>For your complete satisfaction and your pet's welfare, we will discuss with you in detail about your pet's requirements, health and behaviour.</p>
							<p>Thank you for understanding that at Doggiie Dog World, we put your dog's welfare first. We cannot justify hours of torture. Coats grow back surprisingly quickly, but most importantly:</p>

						<p>Doggiie Dog World grooming packages are priced as per the size and breed of your pet, as well as the condition of its coat. With a quick examination, we can inform you about the exact cost of your dog or cat's grooming session. The price will be confirmed with you before we start. </p>
						<p>If your dog / cat should become overly stressed or aggressive while under our care, we reserve the right to stop the grooming process for both, our safety and that of the pet. </p>
						<p>We groom dogs as humanely as possible. All dogs are groomed in view, and in a quiet, clean, smoke-free environment.  No tranquilizers or drugs are used. Pets whose fur is determined to be too tangled or matted will be given a short hair-cut to spare any discomfort. We recommend that the pet is stripped off its matted coat to ensure its well being. With regular grooming appointments, your pet will have a new and shiny coat in no time.</p>
