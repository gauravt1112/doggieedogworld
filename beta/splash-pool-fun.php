						<p class="title">Swimming Is One Of The Best Forms Of Exercise, As It Works On Building Muscle Mass And Tone Through Varied And Increased Range Of Motion.</p>
						<p>Swimming has also proven beneficial for several medical conditions, which include orthopaedic, neurological, soft tissue injuries and degenerative conditions, as well as those related to age - developmental and geriatric.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Buoyancy & Viscosity of water relieves the effect of gravity on the body, allowing it to be weightless, and thus exercising the muscles and joints, without them being stressed. This allows for free movement of limbs, enabling your dog to do more exercises, than it would normally do.</li>
							<li>The water resistance helps in building stamina and endurance, while at the same time enhances muscle tone, posture and performance.</li>
							<li>The water kneads the body gently, giving it a massage-like effect. The hydrostatic pressure serves to provide an anti-inflammatory effect, reducing thereby swelling and resulting in more comfortable and natural limb movements.</li>
							<li>The flow of the moving water is at a controlled temperature. The warmth of the flowing water stimulates the touch receptors on the skin, increasing blood circulation and releasing tight muscles, which effectively aids in healing.</li>
							<li>Controlled swimming results in a generic feeling of well being (due to release of endorphins), improved cardiovascular fitness and in general, an improved quality of life.</li>
							<li>Controlled swimming also aids potentially earlier return to normal activities - very important for owners of Assistance or Working Dogs.</li>
