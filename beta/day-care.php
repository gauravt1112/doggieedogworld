							<p>We will take care of your babies just like our own, providing them with a safe, clean, healthy atmosphere, engage them in activities and most importantly, love, affection, security, comfort and supervision they deserve and desire while you are away.</p>

							<p>Everyone working here at Doggiie Dog World is a die-hard animal-lover! We handle 10-14 dogs and cats a day and make sure that each and every one of them is cared for in their own special way. Our staff is trained to deal with any unusual situations.
