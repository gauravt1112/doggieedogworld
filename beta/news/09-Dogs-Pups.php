		<p class="title">Must haves for your pooch</p>
		<p>Love the leash.</p>
		<p>While choosing a leash it is essential to keep in mind the breed and size of your dog. Smaller breeds should have a lighter weight leash as compared to the bigger breeds.White strong leashes are better and easier to restrain the bigger dogs. Quality and safety should not be compromised upon.</p>
		<p>Best fit for collar.</p>
		<p>The perfect dog collar is one where in the space between your dogs necks is about two fingers wide. Smaller breeds and for puppies who have delicate necks, nylon collar is recommended more than a metal one. Never use shock or pronged collars.</p>
		<p>Thought for the food bowl.</p>
		<p>There are many varieties to choose from that include ceramic or stainless steel dishes, plastic and even glass bowls. The least expensive options are plastic bowls; however, they have a high possibility of harbouring bacteria and residue especially in dented or scratched areas on the surface.</p>
		<p>Toys…not just playing things.</p>
		<p>Look for fun, challenging and safe toys. Ensure the toys cannot be pulled apart easily thus making them safe. These toys can be categorized into chew toys that satisfy the need to gnaw, like hard rubber toys and stuffed animals that provide comfort to dogs; fetching toys, like balls and flying disks; rope and tug toys, which help to floss teeth and critical thinking toys, like treat dispensing devices.</p>
		<p>Exercise for the teeth.</p>
		<p>Coming home to gnawed sofas, footwear and clothes is a sight that most pet parents have experienced. However to reduce the chances of your personal belongings and upholstery to be torn down, invest in a good quality dog chew.</p>
		<p>Love my Tshirt.</p>
		<p>Fond of sports? Get your dog a tee that features your favourite players number as a print, or the teams colors. Remember, nothing to heavy, especially in warm weather.</p>
		
		<p>Accessorise with jewels.</p>
		<p>When it comes to jewellery it isn’t the same for pets as it would be for their human relatives. If you like a little bit of sparkles you can have your pets name on his/her nametag engraved in the front and surrounded in modest crystals.</p>
