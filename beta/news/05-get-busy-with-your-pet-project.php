		<p class="title">Get busy with your pet project</p>
		<p>Do you feel guilty to leave your pet at home all alone while you head out for a busy day at work? Ever thought of dropping them off to school or probably a place where there can be trained or groomed to be taught good manners and social skills? Well now it’s possible as dog trainerbehaviourist Pooja Advani has recently opened It’s A Doggie Dog World, a very special and personalised pet wellness centre and also a one- stop destination for your pets. Being the first in the city and a one of a kind initiative in the country, Doggie Dog World, located in Andheri Lokhandwala is the brainchild of Pooja who has been passionate about pets since a very young age and realised that her true calling lay in working with them. Speaking on this initiative, Pooja said, “ I wanted to do something different.</p>
		<p>We didn’t have a universal centre that caters to every need. We have grooming parlours, veterinary centres but we don’t have rehabilitation centres. We do grooming, day care, boarding and hydrotherapy. So keeping all this in mind, It’s A Doggie Dog World came about.” In addition to just being a day care centre for training, this place is also a rehabilitation centre and Pooja has also introduced a 5 foot wide and 12.4 foot long splash pool where your faithful furry friends get time to play around and get therapeutic pampering at the same time.</p>
		<p>So how different is this place from a veterinary centre? “ I am not a qualified vet. I can’t do a diagnosis. So a dog that has already been diagnosed with a problem comes to me for rehab or maybe if a dog is going in for a major surgery such as hip dysplasia or hip replacement, that’s where I come into play because I make the muscles stronger around the hip with the help of pool activities. So it’s almost like your normal physiotherapy but here we do it in the water. So the dog which has just undergone a hip replacement is having a tough time walking but then he’ll be able to swim better because he can get that range of movements and it’s a controlled range of movements where I can expand those muscles having tightened in, in the water, without him feeling any kind of pain,” Pooja added.</p>
		<p>But before you enter this place, Pooja makes it a point to do a thorough ground check. “ We have an entire registration process before we enrol a dog. We first assess the dog to see if the dog is human friendly or not, then we have a registration form that has to be filled where we take down medication details, we are also very tedious when it comes to documentation and make sure we have all pictures of the dog and the owner together individually, veterinary referrals, BMC registration, current vaccination papers, papers from where has the dog been bought and other details,” Pooja said.</p>
		<p>Post the preliminary test with the pet, the training sessions goes ahead where the dog along with the owner is given special attention for an hour. However, Pooja always makes it a point to ensure that along with the owner, whoever comes in contact is also trained. “ We guarantee training in about 8- 12 sessions.</p>
		<p>We don’t teach the pet how to behave rather we teach the owner how to control the pet. It’s a relationship that we build between the pet and the owner. The dog has to come with the owner and whoever whether its the servant or the driver or whoever, everybody has to be on the same page.</p>
		<p>Everybody saying a command has to say it in the same way. You can’t confuse the dog. Ek ‘ sit down’ bolega aur ek ‘ sit here’ bolega, these are two different commands for your pet. Now if you’re going to say ‘ sit down’ when the dog has just been taught ‘ sit’, the dog is just going to look at you all confused.</p>
		<p>That’s why we teach the owner too,” Pooja said.</p>
		<p>Training right from the start is of utmost importance and the way you raise your puppy tends to determine how it will behave when it is older. According to Pooja, most dogs are not trained and lack socialisation.</p>
		<p>Socialisation is essential for puppies of all breeds as it helps them to blossom into healthy, happy dogs while lack of socialisation may result in timid, fearful dogs.</p>
		<p>And most owners sometimes pick the wrong choice of dogs. “ People are getting breeds by not knowing what they’re really getting into. So when you get a Rottweiler, he’s not a domestic pet, he’s a working dog. You’re taking a working dog and making him into a furniture piece.</p>
		<p>What is going to happen? Boredom leads to irritability, irritability leads to anger, anger will lead to frustration, and frustration will lead to aggression. And aggression is in its genes. You can subdue it, but you can’t eradicate it,” Pooja said.</p>
		<p>But before anyone even thinks of getting a dog into their home, Pooja has something to say. “ A dog or any pet that you get, be prepared it’s a child that never grows up. For 15 to 17 years that’s a life commitment you are making. You are going to clean after it, you’re going to feed it, bathe it, you’re going to train it, you’re going to have issues where everything is concerned and at the end of the day and finally he’s going to be an old dog where you have to absolutely nurse it. Half the people are very emotional towards their dogs. So it’s a big commitment and if you’re ready to make this commitment, then get a dog otherwise don’t get one. Ask me, I feel half the people shouldn’t have dogs.” Given the hustle and bustle of a cosmopolitan city like Mumbai, what does it take to own a dog today and what would be the ideal breed for a middle- class owner. “ A lot of people don’t have budgets. Dogs should not be bought based on your budget but on your lifestyle.</p>
		<p>What is the lifestyle you’re looking at? If you have a very active lifestyle and the space, get a Labrador, who needs that kind of a workout.</p>
		<p>But then there are some people who get the Husky, Shih Tzu but for a middleclass person I would say get a Beagle, or get a short coated dog that doesn’t necessarily have to be given a bath every week, that doesn’t need a haircut every time. If you want a toy breed in your house, get a Pekingese or a Shih Tzu but one thing you have to note here, maintenance wise, they’re high,” Pooja added.</p>
		<p>All in all, the two- month old place has got great response and caters to every breed right from a Chihuahua to Mastiffs. So if you’re looking at a good training sessions for your dog, then for 8- 10 weeks, it costs around Rs1000- Rs1200 and this session is a private session with the dog, the owner and whoever it comes in contact with. “ I charge a bit high cause I come with different qualifications, my services are different and my biggest competition here are other groomers. We give you five private sessions and the rest three are group sessions where we do socialisation process. During the group session, there are different temperaments of owners in the room, different temperaments of dogs are in the room, different temperaments of breeds are in the room so we immunise the dogs to different sounds, different sounds and different people and every owner needs to know how to behave and how to get his dog to behave in different kinds of situations,” Pooja said But always remember your furry friend will never disappoint you and that’s exactly why they are they called a man’s best friend and Pooja reiterates this when she said, “ Lock your wife and lock the dog in your car boot for two minutes and after that see who’s more happy to see you. I think the dog chooses you and once a pet chooses you, he will always be loyal to you. He will give his life to you even if you don’t take care of him,” said Pooja.</p>
