		<p>Doggiie Dog World has come as a boon in our life.  Between my husband's work travel through the week and my long work hours, we needed a home for our little Gogo when we are not around, someone who would love him as much and care for him the way we do. Pooja and team takes care of him like their own, and how do we know that, Gogo though cannot speak lets us know. When we drop him off he runs in and greets everyone at the centre the same way he would do with our family and friends. Gogo has learnt how to interact with other dogs there, who would say he has cute dog friends too.</p>
		<p>Could not thank the wonderful people at Doggiie Dog World enough for taking care of him specially Saddam, who Gogo breaks free from my hand to meet. Putting it simply Gogo today believes he has two homes, one ours and the other being Doggiie Dog World.</p>
		<p>Thanks guys for taking care of Gogo and giving him all the love in your Doggiie Dog World family.<br>Love always,<br>Priti</p>
