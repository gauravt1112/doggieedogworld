		<p>Doggiie Dog World is the answer to all my questions about my Siberian husky. I wanted a place where my boy can exercise, learn, make friends. I was always worried about leaving my boy in a doggy day care since most of the day cares aren't that great when it comes to a dog that needs special care. My husky comes from a family of show dogs so obviously he is a super active and super pampered dog. I've always been skeptical about leaving my dog with anyone not just because I love him too much but also because huskies need xtra attention. But since the time I found out about Pooja and Doggiie Dog World I can blindly leave Leo with them. Firstly, because Pooja is a trained professional for pets and Pooja and team both are animal lovers and they take care of all the dogs extremely well, secondly, everything that I needed for my boy from swimming, obedience training, spa, treatments etc. is taken care of under one roof and the staff here is really friendly my favourite is Saddam. There is no fear of your pet being mishandled behind your back. I blindly trust Doggie Dog World  when it comes to my boy.</p>
