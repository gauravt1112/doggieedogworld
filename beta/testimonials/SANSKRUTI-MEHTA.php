		<p>We absolutely LOVE this place! As Dog parents, we were extremely concerned about the well-being for our beloved youngest family member and were turned off by the other kennel options we came across. Our best option was to beg our maid to stay at our place any time we needed to travel or change our life schedules to make sure our dog was taken care ofâ€¦ UNTIL we came across Doggiie Dog World! Pooja and her team have done a fabulous job in conceptualizing and bringing a wonderful dog boarding experience to Mumbai. The facility is well-maintained and the dogs are not caged the entire time. They have even installed a little play set for the dogs to climb up on and then they can slide back down! I have often thought of dropping off Zelda for daycare just so she could burn off all of her energy by running around and meeting the other dogs. She loves going to Doggiie Dog World and loves making new furry friends. It is also a wonderful place to expose a young dog to other dogs, so they start becoming more social. My husband and I are very happy with the place and with Pooja and her team! Thank You for taking care of Zelda!! She cannot wait to come back and play!!</p>
