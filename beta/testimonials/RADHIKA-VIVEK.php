		<p>Pooja and Doggiie Dog World were initially recommended to me by a neighbour. I checked with my vet who also spoke very highly about the place and about the benefits of hydrotherapy for my 11 year old lab, Benjy, who suffers from arthritis. So I mentally geared up to make the long journey from south Mumbai to Andheri West. And this weekly journey for the past two months has shown amazing results. Benjy is so much more active, walks well and is much steadier on his feet. Pooja is very firm but gentle with her dogs and they all love her. Doggiie Dog World also has daycare and boarding facilities. The place is  clean and the staff is well trained. Great work Pooja!</p>
