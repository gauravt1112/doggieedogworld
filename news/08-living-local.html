		<p class="title">HOW TO TEACH CHILDREN TO HANDLE DOGS</p>
		<p>Ever seen a child jump on a dog or try to ride it or pull its ears? Most children love to play with dogs, however what they may not realize. due to their age and the pet parent's lack of information that most dogs patiently put up with that kind of rough handling. However, you never know when a situation can arise. The wonderful companionship that dogs and children innately share is what has made, since time immemorial, the dog a popular family pet.</p>
		<p>Some dogs when caught unaware or when painfully handled, often react out of sheer tear and confusion and not with the intent to harm. The experience of living with a family dog shouldn't be a traumatic experience for neither the dog nor the child, especially when there are easy steps to prevent the situation. With guidance and the occasional initial supervision your dog and your child can develop safe fulfilling friendships. Here a few tips that will help with the same:</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">First and foremost you should teach your children to always ask pet parents for permission to interact with pets that aren't yours. YOU could practice with stuffed animals at home so that your child is prepared and so that any mishaps are prevented if the dog isn't a cry friendly one. The child when approaching a new dog should ideally first ask permission then softly pet the dog and talk in calm tones to it. Talking softly to the pet tells it that you mean NO harm.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Dogs need time themselves, just as much as humans do and it’s only fair that we sine them the same. 'When your pet is eating or napping, it's better to not disturb or aggravate or pull the dog away from its ‘me’ time. Tell your children, to let the pet be how much ever they may want to play with pet. The pet will automatically, after a good meal or some rest, want to frolic around and play.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Next step is to show your children polite petting. Explain to your child that dogs love to be stroked under the chin, around the ears and paned softly as that makes them feel comfortable. This also means discouraging unpleasant treatments like; poking, pinching, slapping, and pulling on fur, tails or ears. Dogs may find frequent tatting on the head invasive.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">A frisky little puppy can easily -Out of the child's hand and get hurt, or in the process hurt your child too, that's why it is advisable that small children be taught how to carry puppies. The right way to pick up a pup is to place your right hand under the dog's chest, cradle or the bottom with their left hand, and carry, them close to your body. They'll snuggle up and get comfortable then, and are less likely to jump out or your hands.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Children by nature at a small age have a lot of energy and have a tendency to run around and yell, which is something that dogs don't understand. Dogs can eat excited thinking that it's play time and in that excitement hurt the child, or they can gt scared and respond by chasing or even jumping. It's also important to make sure that our child knows teasing the pet is a complete no no, as that too can provoke them.</p>
		
		<p>Even if you’ve got a friendliest dog, a situation can develop in an instant. Although they mean no harm, children can do a number of things to trigger inappropriate actions in dogs and it could stem from a harmless mistake. Here are some things that as a parent and a pet parent you should keep in mind.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">When a dog is startled or in pain, he may bite.  Defence is a natural response even for doc pets. Children may never understand that their actions might end up hurting the pets especially because they are not aware of any warning signs that the pet might give away.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Just like some of us don't like to share our food, dogs can be territorial about the things they like too. They may act in an inappropriate manner if a child comes too close while playing or eating.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Sometimes dogs just don't realize how big and strong they are and in excitement or during palytime  they accidently end up hurting the child. We have to be prepared for scenarios like these especially with large breeds around. Do not yell at the pet, instead teach your children what they should/shouldn’t do.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Many people are okay with children playing roughly with them , however  one should realise taht rather  than things get Out of hand, it is important to teach your child the right way instead. Some parents may allow their child to chase, pull their tails, poke and generally be bothersome to the pet and expect the pet to put up with it in the long run. Allowing, a child to mistreat animals, will give them leeway to do some more often, and with pets that are not their own too. It is imperative that children should know that all living creatures should be treated well.</p>
		
		<p>The best advice is that you at the early stages, supervise all interactions between your pets and your kids. It takes an instant for things go awry. So, watch for signs of trouble and supervise diligently so that you can step in when needed .</p>
		 <p>These potential problerns-shouldp't stop you from getting, a pet. It is a beautiful, relationship that your child should be   introduced to at a young age.</p>
