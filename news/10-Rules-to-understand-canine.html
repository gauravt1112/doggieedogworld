		<p class="title">Rules to understand canine behaviour by Pooja Advani, founder and owner, It’s a Doggiie Dog world.</p>
		<p>Communicating effectively with your dog is very important after all they are known to be mans best friend. Just like we communicate to convey certain things  and have telltale signs that means specific things, so do dogs.</p>
		<p>Dogs have a language that is there way of communicating emotion, feelings, among other things. Although they do use sound to convey what to say, a lot of things about your pets mood wants and needs can be understood by their body language to.</p>
		<p>Understanding what your pets saying will make sure you know, when he’s spooked, scared, tired and even when he’s feeling aggressive. Dogs primarily communicate by smelling, seeing and lastly hearing. How often do you just watch your dog and try and analyse what he’s trying to communicate? Nows the time. By looking at your dogs gate, posture, bark, dogs gait posture, bark , position you can understand what he is feeling just in a glance. </p>
		<p>Here are some basic rules to understand canine behaviour:</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">When your dog assumes the following position, you should know that he is relaxed. His/her ears will be up but not forward, head high, tail down and relaxed, loose stance on the feet and tongue slightly lolling out. But, when his body is lower hackles raised, pupils dialated, nose wrinkle, lips curled, and his tail tucked with little or no movement you should immediately know that there is something or someone that your dog is fearful of and may attack. However if he starts to lick the other dogs or humans face and starts leaving sweaty paw prints and keeps maintaining brief eye contact, that means that your dog is truly fearful and that he wants to surrender or get out of that situation as soon as possible. Your oet is definitely in the mood to play when his tail is up, wagging and when his front end is lowered by bent fore paws. This is the most common invitation that your pet wants to play. He will maintain that position for a split minute and will then break into a random run barking; facing you with head and chest low and legs splayed out is also a sign of playfulness.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Dogs don’t like it when people, or other dogs for that matter stare into their eyes for a longated period of time. When they turn their head away from you, effectively breaking the eye contact, you should know that it is warning sign that you should back of, as that’s the pets way of being polite and avoiding confrontation.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">If your pet is continually standing off balance, ready to dart away at moments notice, that means that there is someone or something that constantly scares him. Try and figure out what that is.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Dogs that travel in a straight line indicating a proud and upright posture are more likely to become dominant, while dogs that walk in curved lines or playfully bound around are the ones who more likely to be friendly and ready to play</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Yawns are usually indications of sleep, but in pets it can also be an indication of stress. Wiith yawning the dog might be trying to displace stress that it is feeling.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">After relieving him/herself if your pet resorts to furiously pawing the ground and repeats the behaviour he/she is primarily trying to establish dominance and mark his/her territory.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">If your pet rolls over in front of you, it is more often than not out of trust and showing respect for authority. Him/she with a belly rub.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Pacing around in an open area it means several different things, ranging from excitement, nervousness or even boredom.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">When your pet freezes in the middle of an action it is because he/she is feeling unsure of him or is prepping himself for an attack of some kind because something has startled him or put him out of whack.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">A tilted head signified that he is either puzzled, listening or uncertain and wants more information</p>
		
		<p>There are some basic signs and rules that once your familiar with, will make communication much easier with your pet and your pets with you.</p>
