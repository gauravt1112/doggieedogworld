		<p class="title">Effective Training tips for your puppy</p>
		<p>The joy of inviting a new member into the family is unparalleled and a wonderful feeling. Puppies are small bundles of joy. But, however cute and cuddly they may be, they also need to be trained as soon as they enter the house, otherwise soon you will be besieged by the havoc that the little thing will create in your house.</p>
		<p>New pet owners usually tend to worry first about what bed to get, what are the kennel or what collar to get. While all of these are valid questions, these should not take priority over training and the right way to do it. Here are some tips to effectively train your puppy:</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;"> Be a leader.<br>
		I have seen it many a times that people who are by nature, strong headed and confident, become lovable and mushy when it comes to their pets. Don't do that, be a leader, an enforcer just like you would with your children. Be affirmative by giving clear commands.</p>
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Housebreaking your puppy.<br>Puppies don't come understanding what is right or wrong and like and like children and they need to be taught. They look up for your guidance. Here are z few things you need to keep in mind while housebreaking a puppy.<br>a)	Puppies think the whole house is theirs to roam and that each part of the house is the same, be it your antique rug in the hall or your pristine white sofa. When you see a puppy urinating in a place it isn't supposed to, take him/her to the right place. Never physically punish the puppy as that's just plain cruelty. It will form negative associations of fear in the puppy's mind and leave the puppy confused and scared of you, and will probably result in worse behaviour. Keep the place always the same so that your pup is familiar with it and returns to the same place to do his business regardless of time.<br>b)	The age of your puppy also makes a difference. Puppies that are weaned to soon face difficulties being house trained. When they are 8 weeks old, that is when they start to understand what is safe for them and what not. That is the same time you need to make sure that your training is consistent.<br>c)	Every morning take your puppy to the same place and don't leave until the puppy has relieved himself so that he gets accustomed to it. He will let go to the same place in future.<br>d)	Once you fell that your puppy has been house broken pat his head in appreciation or reward him with a simple treat.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;"> Dog walking.<br>Puppies, especially have a lot of energy. Once they are old enough, take them for daily walks, runs, maybe even more than once a day so that they learn to let out their energy in the right way.<br>a)	Always make your dog walk by your right side. When your dog walks ahead, it allows the pup the liberty to run straight against the leash. Walk at the same pace as the stride as your pet<br>b)	Use a short leash so that you have more control until the pup is trained.<br>c)	Taking walks early in the morning is ideal. Take out at least 30 minutes to an hour for the walk depending on the breed. Large/giant breeds belonging to the Labradors, Husky, German Shepherds, Dobermans, Mastiffs and Pitbulls need more exercise. These breeds have a lot of energy, are extremely active and have a playful mind, they are thus absolutely not for decoration. If their energy is not channelized correctly, it will lead to a lot of behavioural issues due to complete boredom.<br>d)	Be firm with your pet. Do not hit, shout and scream. A stern, firm tone is enough.<br>e) Proper exercise and spending time with your pet are essential. It will pave way for a long and fruitful relationship with your pet.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Behaviour and Obedience training.<br>It is very important to teach your pet various commands. However, obedience training can be done at any age, even though it is advisable to start at an earlier age as they learn faster and better and are more open to changes in what they may consider natural behaviour. With obedience training, your pet can learn simple commands like sit down, roll over, handshake, fetch and heel etc. your pet can also learn more complex commands through this training which are suited for competitive shows.<br>a)	Training sequences should be short so that the pet doesn't get bored and lose attention. They should be 10-15 minutes long and at intervals.<br>b)	Training before meals is a good idea as the pups will then associate the meal as a reward for good behaviour.<br>c)	Don't get impatient with your pet. Love and affection goes a long way in making sure your pet is in the mood to learn. Dogs are very attuned to human emotion and can sense when you are frustrated or getting annoyed and will reflect the same in their training.<br>d)	Use food or belly rubs and pats as positive reinforcement when you are training your pup.</p>
		
		<p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/phone_icon.png" style="margin:0px 0px 0px -10px;">Socialisation.<br>A well socialised puppy is one who will in future make a good companion and will learn to control himself/herself easily. A dog who hasn't socialised with other pups often turns to fear biting or barking, making it extremely unpleasant to have around other pet owners and pets.<br>a)	Invite friends to meet your pup but make sure you do not over crowd him/her with them.<br>b)	Take your puppy on short drives to get him/her accustomed to moving objects, cars etc.<br>c)	Take your puppy to a wet and a groomer at a young age so that they get accustomed to grooming and getting its nails clipped, hair brushed, bathing and even being inspected early.<br>dd)	Invite pups to socialise and play with your pup, especially of different breeds so that your pup is not scared when it meets a new breed or a slightly aggressive pup.</p>
		
		<p>Hope the above mentioned tips prove to be effective for training your puppy efficiently.</p>
