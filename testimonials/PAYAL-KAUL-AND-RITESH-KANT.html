		<p>We have been a clients of Doggiie Dog World for the last 6 months, but within this time itself we have seen their business grow drastically day by day through sheer hard work and quality client service. Pooja through her centre has provided us with a cost effective, reliable and life saving option for Buddy's Behavioral Training, day care, swimming or grooming sessions. Not once in the time that we have used Doggiie Dog World have they let us down. We have been and would highly recommend them more highly to any dog owner seeking to put his/her loved one in someone else's care. We plan to be a client for many more years to come as we know Buddy just  loves his home away from home, the friends that he has made there and clearly loves all the staff - evident by his over excitement the minute we stop the car outside the centre.</p>
		<p>Honestly speaking, we are very possessive about Buddy and the only person we feel we can trust to make sure he is well looked after when we are not there is Pooja. She not only has great love for dogs but also a lot of experience in understanding their behavior, and has a Centre equipped to meeting any needs they may have. She is amazing and ALWAYS goes above and beyond to make sure the dogs and we are happy. I never worry about Buddy when he is at Doggiie Dog World. She looks after all dogs as if they were her own, and not in a fake way, its a fact. She is genuinely a wonderful person and has a Centre with amazing facilities and the service they provide could not possibly be any better.</p>
		<p>Buddy is so well cared for by Pooja and her team who always put the interests of the Dogs before anything else they do. Buddy just loves running around socializing and having fun with all his doggy friends in a safe and caring environment. He always comes home a really satisfied and happy boy.</p>
