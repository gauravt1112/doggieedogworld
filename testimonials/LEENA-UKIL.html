		<p>My 4 year old dog, Ruby, has had a two week long stay at Pooja's "It's a Doggiie Dog World" and I must say it was a God sent option for me. I am not sure if Ruby was happy to be left at the kennel as they look so sad when left behind but I can guarantee that I had the most stress free holiday. Since the kennel feels more like a home than a regular kennel, I felt that Ruby will get comfortable soon with the disciplined life of food on time, regular walks and air conditioned rooms. The staff is well trained and dog friendly. They know their guests by name and keep an eye out for health issues. I was also very reassured when they kept a record of Ruby's vet and his vaccination details. All goes to show their professionalism and love for the four legged animals:) Definitely worth a try for short or long stays.</p>
