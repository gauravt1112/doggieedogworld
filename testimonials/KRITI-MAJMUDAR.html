		<p>Bringing Mischief to Doggiie Dog World has been the best thing for both him and me. I have never known of a place as clean and professional, yet friendly. Each and every staff member is very careful and extremely kind to pets. Mischief loves the place and runs right in the moment he is anywhere close. Swimming has also helped him build stamina and lose some weight. Thank you Doggiie Dog and your wonderful team.</p>
