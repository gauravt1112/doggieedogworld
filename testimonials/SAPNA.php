		<p>Doggie Dog World is one place where Casper and Junior are more than happy to be there and very sad when I go to pick them up. As we know dogs don't lie. And every time when I go to pick them, their innocent face tells me "no mumma, we want to stay here for some more days". Excellent services, very good staff and absolutely knowledgeable Pooja who knows the in and out of my fur babies needs. Thank you very much for being a second home to my boys.</p>
