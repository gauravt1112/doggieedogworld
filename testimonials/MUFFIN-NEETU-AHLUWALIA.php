		<p class="title">NEETU AHLUWALIA</p>
		<p>I make no bones about the fact that I'm a super hyper mommy and don't trust Muffin with a lot of people.  So when it came to a time where I had to choose a groomer for her, I trusted only her Vet for recommendation and he recommended Pooja to me.  When I got to 'It's a Doggiie Dog world', I knew I had reached the right place as its state-of-the-art and more than anything else, it was clean.  Hygiene ranks really high on my 'must have' list. I liked Pooja from the time I met her as she is friendly and what I loved the most was that she is also a doggy mommy and that gives her an edge over other groomers. Another thing I really liked was that she attended to Muffin personally and didn't leave her with her staff to the do the needful. That was really important for me, as it was Muffin's first grooming session and I was very sure that I didn't want her staff to attend to her.  Pooja was exceptionally good with Muffin and put her at ease immediately by patting her and talking to her.  She even let me watch the session which again was important as I was anxious to know how it would be.  Pooja was very gentle and kept talking to Muffin throughout the session which was great.  Muffin didn't let her finish cutting her hair around the face and Pooja didn't force her as she said that she didn't want to scare her.  I was very pleased with that as I don't want Muffin to develop a fear of grooming sessions.  What really took Pooja to the top of my list of groomers was when she followed up regularly to check how Muffin was doing and kept requesting me to bring her back so that she could finish the face. How many groomers could be bothered about that?  I would highly recommend trusting your pets with her as she is well trained, uses excellent products, has great equipment and facilities available and most of all is a doggy mommy herself and feels for your pet just like she feels for her own!</p>
