		<p class="title">SAMEYO</p>
		<p>Sameyo, my first born, met Pooja for the first time and took to her. I had made up my mind that when she starts her place, I will send him to her and so I did. He has been going to Doggiie Dog World for a year now. I think, she grooms him extremely well. Plus points of this place, excellent environment, very trustworthy and most of all, extremely loving. I am  a very passive pet parent and would not leave Sameyo anywhere with out my supervision, but with Pooja and team, I leave him without a blink of an eye. If you love your little one, treat him every week to a spa day and swim with this team.</p>
