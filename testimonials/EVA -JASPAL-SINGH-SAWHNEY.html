		<p class="title">JASPAL SINGH SAWHNEY</p>
		<p>We have known Pooja much before she started with her venture. Trained professionally to understand the pets in human terms, we engaged her over long conversations while we were getting ready for a lifelong commitment.</p>
		<p>Moving forward, she was our obvious choice when we had to plan a vacation as we wouldn't trust anyone else for safekeeping and care taking of our loved 1 year old cocker, Eva.</p>
		<p>The center is a home away from home for the pets and the staff is extremely hands on. The facility is designed with safety of pets as a top priority and a play area to boot up with a generous swimming pool.</p>
		<p>Here are some basic rules to understand canine behaviour:</p>
		<p >It indeed is a world in itself and serves not just the boarding requirements but also for all grooming and veterinary care.</p>
		<p >The gloom of leaving behind Eva was only compensated with the knowledge that we are leaving her in the good hands of Pooja and in a center where she will be safe.</p>
		
		<p >Plan to bring Eva around even more often for her to enjoy the pool and for her grooming requirements.</p>
		
		<p >Wish Pooja all the very best and highly recommend her center to anyone requiring boarding services for their loved pets and for other grooming needs.</p>
