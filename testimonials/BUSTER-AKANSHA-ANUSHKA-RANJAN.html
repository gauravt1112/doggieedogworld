			<p>Taking Buster to Its a Doggiie Dog World is probably the best 1 hr of our week! It's literally my happy place. Even though our doggy is scared of swimming, he loves the outing. The place is great, the best people taking care of your pet there, probably the only people we'd be comfortable leaving Buster with for so much time. Not only has the hydro-therapy helped him heal, but its even a good exercise for him in general. The staff there takes really good care of our dog and he looks adorable everytime he's back from his hair cut and grooming! Its a Doggiie Dog World is a great place which has really come to be useful for us and Buster. And the fact that he couldn't walk for over 3 months and the hyrdo therapy there has helped him recover almost 100%, we probably could not ever be happier with the place!</p>
