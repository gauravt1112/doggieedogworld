		<p>The first time I got my dog, Al, back after his swim and wash from the Doggiie Dog World, the supervisor in my building asked me if I got back home a new family member!!!</p>
		<p>Al has frantically played "the damsel in distress" during his swimming sessions several times, only to be saved by Pooja.</p>
		<p>As bizarre as it may sound, he has overcome his fear of water and fetches the ball from the other end of the pool to impress her!</p>
		<p>She has ensured he can move his paws and hinds to be able to swim (a task I thought was impossible) in just four sessions!</p>
		<p>Every visit is a delight, be it for Al, or myself, since it's one of the few places you can discuss your love for animals, without being considered crazy.</p>
		<p>The duo's passion cannot be questioned, especially when one sees the paw marks on Pooja's arms and team's warmest welcome in her excited voice when one walks into the centre!</p>
		<p> I'd recommend everyone with a furry family member to visit this place, at least once. The wonderful experience will ensure you keep visiting.</p>
