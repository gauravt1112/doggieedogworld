				<p class="title">Doggiie Dog World Is A One Stop Pet Services And Wellness Centre.</p>
				<p>A very special and personalised pet centre, Doggiie Dog World, has been a long awaited dream for owner Pooja Advani.</p>
				<p>Having worked at and managed different grooming salons internationally, Pooja decided to translate her passion for animals by bringing the international concept of a luxury pet wellness centre in the form of Doggiie Dog World. Pooja's love for dogs started as a child with her very first pets Tootsie and Prince. However her current pets Bobo and Baloo are the true inspiration behind her pet venture - Doggiie Dog World.</p>
				<p>Passionate about animals since a young age, she soon realised that her true calling lay in working with them. In 2010, Pooja moved to Singapore to educate herself in various aspects of pet care and received certification as Certified Groomer, Dog Trainer & K9 Behaviorist, Hydrotherapist. She worked for 3 years in Singapore to get first hand experience as a Specialist - K9 Cosmetology & Trainer. To widen her horizon of knowledge, she went to London to gain further knowledge and train as a Hydrotherapist.</p>

				<p><br>After returning to India, she decided to set up a full fledged pet care centre, in an independent 2500 sq.ft. air-conditioned bungalow with the latest international equipment, products and a pool with UV sterilisation.</p>
				<p>As a dog owner herself she understands the pride one takes in a healthy, well-groomed and well-mannered pet. All the activities are done and managed by Pooja personally. She specialises in hand scissoring and specific styling for different breeds, giving you peace of mind that your babies are in capable hands.</p>
